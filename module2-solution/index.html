    As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
    bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
    and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
    blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
    sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
    he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
    properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
    that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
    differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
    are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
    with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
    and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
    brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
    which his animals on his dunghills are as much
    bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
    plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
    me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
    me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
    gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
    grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
    think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
    servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
    know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</section>

    Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
    that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
    to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
    To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
    escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
    well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
    for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
    must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
    out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
    withal, that either you might stay him from his
    intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
    run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
    and altogether against my will.

    Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
    thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
    myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
    have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
    it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
    it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
    of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
    good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
    me his natural brother: therefore use thy
    discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
    as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
    thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
    mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
    against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
    treacherous device and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
    for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
    it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
    day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
    should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
    blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
